## Usage
In the parktivities application a user can find park information through state name or activity.  First the user has to select a state or activity from their respective drop down. If the user selects a state then the user can see all park names for that state and if the user searchs by activity then the user will see all parks which have that particular activity. Then the user can click on a park name for park information like, an image of that park, description, activities and location. The user can see all park names which user previously viewed. so if a user wants to see previously seleted park information again then the user just has to click on a park name listed on national park search history list. We also use local storage for persistant data on the user's browsing history.
